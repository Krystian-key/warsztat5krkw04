## Hello There, Im Krystian Kluczkiewicz here are the informations about my application! ðŸ‘‹

## About Aplication:
### The aim of the workshop is to write a backend functionality for cataloging books using the REST method.
### As part of the workshop, I created an API identical to the one made available during the previous workshop (Javascript and Jquery).
### I used Spring MVC, an additional Jackson library, and additional annotations to create the API.

## Project Goal?
- For the final verification of the correctness of my api, I used the previous frontend workshop - only changing the api address that it was supposed to use.
